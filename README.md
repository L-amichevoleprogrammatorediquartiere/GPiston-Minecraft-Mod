### <a name="presentation"> Presentation </a>
From the first time that i played minecraft, the first thing that i would have wanted to do is build bigger structure, that you can move with only a button, but the default piston are not enough for this task. So now that i haved to do my university exam and learn java, i take the opportunity and i have writed this mod.....   This block can move many block from a direction to another (the player choice the direction and the number of block)

So this is the block that i have created:

Now i can finally build my massive structure mobile like a bridge hidden that appears when you click a button and other sick idea

Block turned off:

Block turned on:

### <a name="menu"> Menu </a>
When you right click on the block appear the follow menu:

First of all, with the button + and - you can add or remove the number of block.
Insted with the button (left,right,above,below) you can choice the input direction and the output direction
> [!CAUTION]
> Click every time 2 times, the direction, the first time you choice the input the second time you choice the output, if you click just one time the the result is unexpected (but if you want to fix it, do it thanks)

### <a name="power_supply"> Power supply and other function</a>
When you try to turn on the block, with the redstone or other signal block
> [!WARNING]
> You can only feed it from the side, if you try another way the result is unexpected

Don't be sad, to this limitation because if you have mutilple gPiston block near, if you turn on one, the blocks near the lit block will light up:
