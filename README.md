### <a name="presentation"> Presentation </a>
From the first time I played Minecraft, the first thing I wanted to do was build bigger structures that you can move with just a button, but the default pistons are not enough for this task. So now that I had to do my university exam and learn Java, I took the opportunity and I wrote this mod. This block can move many blocks from one direction to another (the player chooses the direction and the number of blocks).

So this is the block that i have created:

Now i can finally build my massive structure mobile like a bridge hidden that appears when you click a button and other sick idea

Block turned off:

Block turned on:

### <a name="menu"> Menu </a>
When you right-click on the block, the following menu appears:

First of all, with the button + and - you can add or remove the number of block.
Insted with the button (left,right,above,below) you can choice the input direction and the output direction
> [!CAUTION]
> Click two times every time to choose the direction: the first time you choose the input, the second time you choose the output. If you click just once, the result is unexpected (but if you want to fix it, please do).

### <a name="power_supply"> Power supply and other function</a>
When you try to turn on the block with redstone or another signal block.
> [!WARNING]
> You can only feed it from the side, if you try another way the result is unexpected

Don't be discouraged by this limitation because if you have multiple gPiston blocks nearly, turning on one will cause the blocks near the lit block to light up.
